This repository contains various Computer Graphics (CG) algorithms and techniques implemented as part of a practical assignment. The project demonstrates several key algorithms, pattern generation, fractal design, and geometric transformations commonly used in computer graphics. These implementations are designed to help visualize the inner workings of CG techniques and aid in the study of graphics programming.
Features : 
(1) DDA Line Drawing Algorithm: Implementation of the Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm for drawing straight lines.
(2) Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm: Efficient algorithm for drawing lines with integer-based calculations.
(3) Line Filling Algorithms: Techniques to fill the pixels of a line segment for graphical applications.
(4) Scanline Polygon Filling: Algorithm to fill polygons using horizontal scanlines, commonly used in raster graphics.
(5) Pattern Generation: Basic pattern generation algorithms, including checkerboards and stripes.
(6) Snowflake Fractal (Koch Curve): Generation of the famous fractal snowflake pattern using recursive algorithms.
(7) Geometric Transformations: Implementations of 2D and 3D transformations, including translation, scaling, and rotation.
This README file provides a clear and structured explanation of the project, its functionality, and usage instructions. You can adjust or expand upon this template as needed to suit your specific implementation or any additional features you might want to include.
